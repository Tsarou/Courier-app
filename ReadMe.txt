This is a mock courier app

Once the superuser is created they can run the server and manage the courier operations from the courier company side.

For example create customers, parcels, deliveries, change delivery status etc


The customer can visit the main page where they can enter the tracking number of one of their parcels and see all of its available information (including status, planned delivery date etc).

Once they have searched for a parcel they are offered the option to change the scheduled delivery date with a date that suits them best.
